jprichardson/electron-mocha,mocha,2015-09-15T16:54:35Z,readme clairifcation: jsdom as prerequisite for testing renderer?. hello there.i've started using your test suite as its really useful.however i'm at a loss as to how to extend the renderer test example that you have included in the repository but by chance discovered that the syntax seems exactly the same as jsdom. i'm aware that what i'm asking might be novice level oblivious but  basically i can use jsdom (below) to create an empty window.document object. which can then be populated with divs or whatever elements you need to mock for your dom testing. the phrasing on your repo makes it seem like this repository is all that is needed for testing elements in the dom. so is jsdom part of the electron-mocha package?```jsdom()it('has document'. function () {  var div = document.createelement('div')  expect(div.nodename).eql('div')})```,neutral
jprichardson/electron-mocha,mocha,2015-09-15T18:25:59Z,create a file named `test.js`. in it. put the following:``` jsvar assert = require('assert')it('something'. function () {  var div = document.createelement('div')  assert.strictequal(div.nodename.

jprichardson/electron-mocha,mocha,2015-09-16T12:27:53Z,no. `jsdom` is an emulation of the dom in node.js. if using it. you'll miss out on most non-dom apis (any web api that isn't dom related e.g. websockets. web storage. etc). `electron-mocha` is a real dom using chrome and thus. you get every web api available in chrome.,negative

babel/babel-loader,eslint,2015-11-04T23:43:32Z,coutothe problem is that it is currently an on/off switch which tells babel whether to search for **.babelrc** or notthere's currently no way to specify a specific file to usefor example. `eslint` has a **--config** flag (**.eslintrc** is just a convenient default). `jsdoc` has a **--configure** flag. `scss-lint` has a **--config** flag for specifying a configuration file to use.this is basically the reason why to this day i was not able to use **.babelrc** on my project (but i really want to for obvious reasons).for the api functions it's not that big a deal. because it's easy to pass a config object to them.as to the cli it's not as easy. and not possible in some cases.i would also just love it if the configuration could be written in the yaml format (just a personal preference).,negative
babel/babel-loader,eslint,2015-11-16T20:42:42Z,`eslint-loader` as a pre-loader + react transform babel plugin + redbox error-catching _with custom styles_ is how i stumbled onto this; the custom styles file got some crazy generated path on account of the loaders still being in the file path provided to babel.i suspect it's a pretty straightforward way to reproduce. i can try to conjure it back up. if that would be helpful.,negative

angular/protractor,standard,2015-04-08T08:20:10Z,smolations i see your point. i recognise that is the standard methodology. i still think that its sometimes useful to have a fully integrated e2e test and given the possible misnomer created by the term 'end to end' and the expectations it creates it would be a 'nice to have' idea to have this work with moderately realistic response times (say up to 10 seconds which i get from my ios functional testing suite for example). alternatively the documentation could point out the current behavior and the suggested methodology so that it helps a beginner.  for me i like to use a unit testing framework to test my backend api which i call an integration test. but i still see some value in aping the sequencing/timing of a realistic user scenario against a backend using the e2e test that can be run repetitively to simulate a realistic usage.,positive
angular/protractor,selenium,2014-03-26T21:00:35Z,this does not look like a protractor error - i think your selenium server may need to be updated. can you try running `webdriver-manager update`? or re-installing?,neutral

angular/protractor,selenium,2014-04-02T19:04:52Z,hey. sorry for the super slow movement on this. since the runner and launcher have been pretty heavily refactored. this pr probably needs to be rewritten. i'd be happy to take a look at a new one. but i think it would be better served in a brand new pr so i'm closing this.my main concern with this feature is to make sure that it works cleanly without adding too much magic. i wonder if a wrapper using `webdriver-manager` that started up selenium if it wasn't already going would be a cleaner design?,positive

angular/protractor,selenium,2014-04-09T17:28:25Z,hi mcalthrop i face the same problem that you describe in the beginning and i cannot even get phantomjs to run. i point the binary path to a local installation of phantomjs and i tried passing various options in the cli.args with no difference. i still get the same error that you have in your first post and phantomjs never runs. the tests that i try to run are the example specs from protractor. i started a selenium server locally using webdriver-start. everything works fine for chrome and firefox. i know this is still an open issue probably related to phantomjs but would love to get phantomjs at least running. what was the protractor config that resolved this problem? thanks a lot,positive
angular/protractor,selenium,2014-04-10T11:42:47Z,i'm working in an environment where internet access is a bit spotty. to prevent connections issues we try to keep all build dependencies hosted inside our lan.we've managed this for the most part by using a self-hosted npm repository. however we run into trouble when npm modules start downloading things themselves. such as the chromedriver node module. we'd like to provide the chromedriver binary on every build environment using automated provisioning where we can use os level package management like apt-get. sadly the chromedriver module does not detect this binary when it's on the $path. one way to fix this. is to configure protractor's chromedriver setting to something like '/usr/bin/chromedriver'. but this does not work well across different oss. having the chromedriver module to also look inside $path would be ideal in this scenario.your suggested solution to provide a selenium standalone instead might also do the trick.,negative

npm/npm,standard,2014-07-17T15:45:34Z,i think it is very much a npm related question and not a question for the package owners (afterall you use npm to install the packages). npm has several nice options for managing production vs development and pruning unwanted packages - go through npm history and you will see a lot of discussion on options and functionality. in a dev environment. the documents and tests are important. in a (small footprint) production environment they are clutter (except for license info etc). working on devices with small footprints this would be a very useful addition to npm for me. of course i can use find/rm and remove what i don't want. but why not use a tool. my assumption is that seeing as package owners can put what they want where ever it would be near impossible for npm to determine what's required without some standardization of folder structures.,negative

(it is not failing in any of that. only in the assert after everything).surprisingly if i create a simpler test which just uses process.nexttick then mocha reports things properly as you had mentioned.so could it be related to using jsdom and its jsdom.jquerify?let me know if you have any ideas. i will update this issue if i can figure anything more out.thanks!,negative
mochajs/mocha,mocha,2012-02-24T00:20:22Z,i guess it is not exclusively a problem with jsdom because when i run the test in the browser (where it doesn't need jsdom) and simply put the code in a settimeout to make it async. mocha doesn't catch the exception either. it reports script error in the mocha report and if i open the javascript console. i can see uncaught assertionerror.... so something is preventing it from catching assertion error in the browser too.,negative
mochajs/mocha,mocha,2012-02-24T14:14:58Z,sorry. had a syntax error that i overlooked.  is there a way that i can test `post`. `put` & `delete` and send data along the request by modifying your above example?are you guys sure that this can't be included or at least mentioned in in the documentation? i absolutely pulled my hair before i found this post.performing response-testing probably is what many people are looking for and it's a shame that they choose a different testing component when mocha seems so mature.,negative
mochajs/mocha,mocha,2012-02-24T15:52:27Z,theindustry there's no reason to package it in mocha. it's unrelated to the client-side and it's not the be-all end-all solution for testing http. eventually i'll be recommending visionmedia/superagent for testing http related stuff but it's not quite there yet,neutral
mochajs/mocha,mocha,2012-02-24T16:36:11Z,visionmedia do you mean that in the browser you see the assertion details in the mocha report. or do you mean that you only see that the test case failed and the details are script error (and you have to go to the developer js console to see the actual details)?,neutral
mochajs/mocha,mocha,2012-02-25T03:46:53Z,remove hard dependency on growl for test suite. currently mocha's own tests won't run without growl. because the checked in test/mocha.opts includes `--growl`.i could change the mocha.opts locally. but i don't like being stuck with outstanding changes. i could install growl. but it's a lot of effort (and i don't actually want it).perhaps the --growl option should have no effect (and print a warning) if require('growl') fails?,negative
mochajs/mocha,mocha,2012-02-25T22:05:33Z,does mocha not capture the stdout of the tests? i figured it did and just passed it along to the console.,neutral

mochajs/mocha,mocha,2012-03-05T13:05:21Z,json-cov reporter should not print report to stdout. hi.when running `mocha --reporter json-cov`. the coverage report is printed to `process.stdout`.the consequence is that logs are mixed with the json coverage report. we are not using html-cov.this forces us to parse stdout content and separate logs fron the json report. it's dirty coding and pretty much unreliable.mocha could take an extra parameter like `--file <filename>` so that we can separate logs from reports.thanks.- nicolas,neutral
mochajs/mocha,mocha,2012-03-05T16:10:05Z,why do you log in your tests? that's bound to look a bit nasty regardless. or why not use a separate stream for your logs?,neutral
mochajs/mocha,mocha,2012-03-05T16:22:36Z,we are generating logs both in the tests and in the application that is under test.we do this because it gives more information when a test fails.it makes sense that logs are redirected to stdout. i'm not sure it's a good practice to redirect json reports to stdout however.i'm surprised to be the first one to stumble upon this issue. is nobody generating logs in their application ?edit: by the way. thanks for answering so promptly :),positive
mochajs/mocha,mocha,2012-03-05T16:39:03Z,most people make the logs conditional. it would mess up any test runner output pretty badly. anyway though currently jscov/htmlcov are just regular reporters so they output to stdout like the rest. but we could possibly add support for multiple reporters and allow the user to specify if they output to stdout or to a file.,positive

mochajs/mocha,mocha,2012-03-06T13:46:42Z,added possibility to ignore leaks in browser usage. hi.i refactored the run method to handle options. doing so i moved the currently passed reporter to the options and also added the possibility to ignore leaks via the options object.in the browser you can now use the following:```<script>  $(function() {    mocha.run({      ignoreleaks: true    })  })</script>```with best regards.sascha depold,neutral

mochajs/mocha,mocha,2012-03-06T13:59:37Z,yeah. i think we need the option of a function that can act as a filter on those.your tests would be a ton better if instead of ignoring all globals you could ignore `jquery*` ones.,neutral
mochajs/mocha,mocha,2012-03-06T14:01:40Z,true. that would also help a lot :) but as you have this option for the command line tool. it might be cool to also support it in the browser?,positive

mochajs/mocha,mocha,2012-03-09T10:29:21Z,added browser setup options. the problem is that the place of a setting is scattering.ui setting is `setup()`. reporter setting is `run()`. globals setting is `runner.globals()`. timeout is inner testing `this.timeout()`.this patch can be `setup()` arguments all settings.for example.```mocha.setup({  ui: 'bdd'.  globals: ['okglobala'.

appium/appium,selenium,2013-05-22T17:18:59Z,any particular reason for websocket vs tcp socket or unix socket? this will be a big client-side change for all the selenium clients and i want to make decisions that will make it easy to adopt this extension.,neutral
appium/appium,selenium,2013-05-22T17:32:16Z,there are a lot of different websocket protocol implementations and client libraries sometimes have lagged to keep up. it also has a bit of http overhead.that being said it's something people are at least familiar with and the situation with support will only improve.i just wanted to think about this for a bit because it's going completely outside the selenium protocol as it stands. and i want us to be thought leaders in the sense of convincing everyone else this is the right way to do things for alert automation in general. not just for appium.,neutral
appium/appium,selenium,2013-05-22T17:42:29Z,i agree jlipps.  i don't have an answer for you however. as i'm not as familiar with selenium as you guys are.  however. the pushing of alerts to the client is i think outside the scope of selenium.  perhaps. we could add a mobile command to setup the socket with a namespace or something...as for why websockets. i looked for something that wouldn't require another port. and played well with express.  and from it's documentation. socket.io seems to keep express at the top of it's priority list:,positive

appium/appium,selenium,2013-06-03T15:52:13Z,no. this is not the model appium uses. appium is ui-focused testing. meaning testing the way a user would test. on this model. you need to read results off the ui state itself.nothing prevents you from building this capability into your app and hooking it into your test. similarly to how with web-based selenium tests. the test runner still has access to e.g.. the app database. but it is outside of what appium intends to provide.,neutral

appium/appium,selenium,2013-06-14T18:10:25Z,"orientation works using the selenium orientation commands. these commands are supported to different extents in the language bindings. i've heard java hasn't implemented them very well. but that's not an appium issue. you can see examples of changing the orientation in `test/functional/webview/orientation.js`:``` jsdescribewd('orientation'. function(h) {   var testorientation = function(specorientation) {     it('should get and set - ' + specorientation. function(done) {       h.driver.setorientation(specorientation. function(err. orientation) {         should.not.exist(err);         orientation.should.eql(specorientation);         h.driver.getorientation(function(err. orientation) {           should.not.exist(err);           orientation.should.eql(specorientation);           done();         });       });     });   };   _.each([""landscape"".

appium/appium,mocha,2013-05-23T22:00:09Z,ok. with the modifications in #643 so far. things kind of work. where they don't work is that selendroid opens up the wrong app.when i run this```mocha -t 60000 test/functional/selendroid```the first test finishes ok. but the subsequent tests (which are supposed to open another app) fail because the first app is opened instead. all the app package names and paths look correct. what could be going on? some kind of bad manifest inserting?,neutral

jshint/jshint,jshint,2012-02-06T09:46:37Z,`new` isn't optional. you get two different objects returned from `new foo()` and just `foo()`what you have written is a factory. not a constructor. so you should not uppercase the first character (and you might rename  it to `constructorfactory`).in your case. the factory returns an object of the expected type - that's good. but not ensured.i know it's widely used (likely due to to the misunderstanding that `new` is optional *g*). but it seems like it produces more problems (e.g. `this`. but also prototype if you just return an object) than expected - and that's exaclty what jshint is for ;)i think. jshint should even warn if a constructor never returns `this`.so we need a new option to allow factories as well as constructors. `newcap` is not the right one.,neutral
